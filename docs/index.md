# Welcome to Naruto-Pixel-Burst project !

This is project is building currently with [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org). I planned to use [Qt5](https://www.qt.io/) for the main menu and SFML windows only for the fights.
This is my first 2D game using SFML. As I'm currently a student, I could probably work on the project only during holydays.

# The game

It's a little 2D naruto fight game, but I would probably add characters from other anime like Goku, Gon, Ichigo ... 
You could use some jutsu, combo and so on, like a normal old fashion fight game !

# Participate 

Feel free to participate to the project if it seems interesting to you.
You can also give advice or critics everything to help me improve the code and so my coding skills.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(int argc, char **argv){
  string visitor= "you";
  bool u_r_awesome=true;
  
  if(u_r_awesome)
    cout<<"Thanks you fellow, you are awesome !"
  else
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;

}
```
